# 07. Mail Mutations and Provider Effects

## Effect Model

Mail mutations cross authority boundaries. SQLite cannot make an IMAP or SMTP
effect atomic with local persistence. Each workflow therefore identifies its
independent provider effects, revalidates authority before each, records the
available protocol evidence, and returns per-target success, failure, unknown,
or success-with-warning.

Mutation policy is deny-by-default for protected effect classes. The management
UI in this delivery exposes no mail mutation route.

## Common Mutation Pipeline

For each target, in caller order:

1. validate all request and aggregate limits;
2. read and validate the current account, mailbox, and effective policy;
3. qualify current provider state and required capability;
4. check cancellation before the effect begins;
5. resolve only the required selected-account secret and construct the provider;
6. execute one bounded provider effect;
7. classify protocol evidence without guessing;
8. update or invalidate the metadata projection in a separate local phase;
9. preserve provider success if projection work fails, adding a bounded warning.

Independent targets continue or stop according to the documented per-tool
policy, but already completed effects are never rolled back fictionally. Results
preserve input order.

## Public Numeric IDs

Existing public message IDs identify one canonical positive decimal ASCII mailbox
UID for compatibility. Zero, leading zero, non-ASCII digits, signs, UID ranges or
sets, control characters, and values above the IMAP UID limit are rejected before
provider access. The low-level provider entry repeats that validation before
opening IMAP as defense in depth. IDs do not carry the UIDVALIDITY observed during
a prior listing. Before a
mutation the service selects the current account/mailbox, obtains current
UIDVALIDITY where feasible, and avoids using stale projected placement as proof.
It does not claim to detect every listing-epoch race. An epoch-bound public
identifier requires a future versioned contract.

## Flags and Read State

`set_email_flags` changes one bounded list of UIDs with exactly one operation,
`add` or `remove`, and one non-empty unique flag list. The public mutable set is
limited to `\Seen`, `\Flagged`, `\Answered`, and `\Draft`. `\Recent` is
server-controlled, provider-specific keywords are outside the portable
contract, and `\Deleted` remains exclusively owned by the scoped
`delete_emails` workflow.

The provider issues one UID-scoped `+FLAGS.SILENT` or `-FLAGS.SILENT` command per
target, preserving caller order and per-UID evidence without claiming
multi-target atomicity. Mark-read remains a focused MCP workflow and delegates
to the same implementation as adding `\Seen`; removing `\Seen` provides the
explicit mark-unread operation. Body reads do not mutate flags unless their
separate `mark_as_read` option requests the focused workflow. Tagged protocol
completion produces individual success, failure, or unknown outcomes, and an
ambiguous effect is not retried automatically.

## Save or Append

Saving a message to a mailbox is an IMAP APPEND effect. The request bounds
headers, recipients, subject, body, encoded message bytes, attachments, and
destination. File attachments preserve their inferred MIME main type and subtype
rather than being coerced into `application/*`. APPEND flags accept system flags
and provider keywords only when each is one complete IMAP atom; legal keyword
forms such as `$Forwarded`, dotted names, and leading digits are not narrowed by
a local identifier grammar, while controls and protocol specials are rejected.
Every APPEND path serializes the complete MIME message with CRLF line endings and
does not emit bare LF or CR line breaks, including draft and sent-copy placement.

Message encoding and IMAP session mode are separate decisions. After
authentication and before selecting a mailbox, every APPEND workflow refreshes
capabilities. A message whose address-bearing or thread headers require RFC 6532
syntax requires an enabled UTF-8 session; a `UTF8=ONLY` server requires that
session even for an ASCII-header message. Negotiation requires `ENABLE` plus
`UTF8=ACCEPT` or `UTF8=ONLY` and is accepted only after positive `ENABLED
UTF8=ACCEPT` evidence.

Once enabled, LIST mailbox names are interpreted as their literal UTF-8 spelling
and SELECT/APPEND use escaped UTF-8 quoted syntax rather than Modified UTF-7. The
message itself uses RFC 6855 `UTF8 (~{N}` literal8 framing only when its headers
actually require RFC 6532; an ASCII-header message on `UTF8=ONLY` still uses the
base message literal. Missing or incomplete required capability evidence returns
the fixed `utf8-append-unsupported` failure before SELECT or APPEND. A
cancellation, timeout, or transport failure after the synchronizing APPEND starts
aborts the connection and is never replayed automatically.

Success requires positive APPEND evidence. If APPEND succeeds but UID mapping or
projection update is unavailable, the result remains success with an unknown
placement/projection warning rather than resubmitting.

## Move and Archive

A move uses native UID MOVE when the provider advertises and supports it. A
fallback may use UID COPY followed by a deletion/expunge sequence only when the
provider offers a scoped primitive that cannot expunge unrelated messages.

Archive resolves an explicit destination policy and then follows the same move
contract. Destination creation, if supported, is a separate effect with its own
policy and evidence; it is not silently attempted after an unsafe fallback.

## Delete and Scoped Expunge

Delete marks only selected UIDs and removes only those targets with a scoped
provider primitive. Allowed strategies are:

- native UID MOVE to trash under explicit policy;
- UID STORE plus UID EXPUNGE when UIDPLUS/scoped expunge is available;
- another provider primitive proven to affect only requested targets.

Bare mailbox-wide `EXPUNGE` is forbidden. If a provider lacks a safe scoped
primitive, the operation rejects before marking any message deleted. It MUST NOT
attempt an unsafe best effort.

## SMTP Delivery and Sent Copy

The configured sender identity remains structured across protocol boundaries.
The account email address is the RFC 5321 reverse-path used by `MAIL FROM`; the
optional display name is formatted and quoted only in the RFC 5322 `From` header.
A provider adapter MUST NOT recover an envelope sender by parsing a formatted
header, and a parse failure MUST NOT fall back to sending that complete header as
the reverse-path. The same correctly formatted `From` header is used for SMTP
message data, drafts, and Sent copies.

SMTPUTF8 is required when any envelope sender or recipient addr-spec is
non-ASCII, or when any From, Sender, To, Cc, Bcc, Reply-To, Message-ID,
In-Reply-To, or References header requires RFC 6532 syntax. The complete message
is serialized under the matching policy and `SMTPUTF8` is requested on `MAIL`;
a provider without the extension returns the fixed `smtp-utf8-unsupported`
failure before `MAIL`, `RCPT`, or `DATA`. A non-ASCII display name paired with an
ASCII addr-spec remains an encoded RFC 5322 display name and does not alone
require SMTPUTF8.

SMTP delivery and IMAP sent-copy APPEND are independent effects:

    participant A as Application service
    participant S as SMTP
    participant I as IMAP
    A->>A: validate and revalidate send policy
    A->>S: submit bounded message
    alt SMTP known success
      S-->>A: accepted evidence
      A->>A: revalidate sent-copy policy and authority
      A->>I: append identical logical message to Sent
      alt APPEND success
        I-->>A: placement evidence
        A-->>A: delivered + sent_copy_saved
      else APPEND failure or unknown
        I-->>A: failure or ambiguity
        A-->>A: delivered + sent_copy_failed_or_unknown
      end
    else SMTP failure or unknown
      S-->>A: failure or ambiguity
      A-->>A: do not attempt success-dependent replay
    end
```

A sent-copy failure MUST NOT trigger SMTP resubmission. The result separately
reports delivery and sent-copy outcomes. If SMTP is unknown, automated replay is
forbidden; operator reconciliation is required.

Message-ID or other local identifiers can aid reconciliation but do not create
exactly-once guarantees.

### Forward

Forwarding an existing message is a send workflow with one additional preceding
provider effect. It performs three independent effects, each preceded by a fresh
read and validation of current account lifecycle, capability, and policy:

1. a bounded IMAP read of the source message in the requested source mailbox;
2. SMTP delivery of the newly composed message;
3. the IMAP sent-copy APPEND described above.

The source read MUST complete successfully before an SMTP session is opened. A
failed, denied, cancelled, or ambiguous source read aborts the workflow with no
delivery attempt, because a forward delivered without the parts it was supposed
to carry is silent content loss rather than partial success. The service MUST
NOT substitute an empty or partial body for an unreadable source.

The composed subject derives from the source subject with one `Fwd:` prefix and
is not prefixed again when the source subject already carries that prefix in any
letter case. Forwarded content is re-composed as a bounded plain-text block
carrying the original's originator, recipient, date, and subject headers; it does
not reproduce the source's HTML rendering, and it is bounded by the same compose
body limits as other send input. Re-attached parts preserve their source MIME
main type, subtype, and parameters rather than being coerced into
`application/*`.

The source read is a mail read and is subject to the sender allowlist under the
same privacy rule as every other read path: a blocked source is not
distinguishable from a missing one. The forward's own recipients are subject to
the recipient allowlist before any provider effect. Delivery and sent-copy
outcomes are represented independently under the rules above; an ambiguous SMTP
outcome is `unknown`, sets `reconciliation_needed`, and is never automatically
replayed.

## Authority Changes Between Effects

Before sent-copy, destination creation, or another independent effect, the
service re-reads current account lifecycle, endpoint/binding revision, and policy.
If authority was disabled or tightened after SMTP success, the secondary effect
is skipped with an explicit policy/authority outcome while SMTP success remains
reported.

## Timeouts, Cancellation, and Ambiguity

Deadlines bound connection and protocol commands where the provider adapter can
enforce them. Cancellation before an effect yields cancelled/no-effect. Once
bytes or a mutation command may have reached a provider, interrupted evidence is
classified unknown unless the protocol proves success or failure.

Retries are allowed only for operations proven idempotent under the same current
authority and request identity. Non-idempotent APPEND, SMTP delivery, move, or
delete is not automatically replayed after unknown. Every public aggregate that
contains an `unknown` target, APPEND, delivery, or sent-copy outcome sets
`reconciliation_needed=true` as a model invariant; successful projection
invalidation cannot clear provider ambiguity.

## Result Bounds and Error Safety

Mutation requests bound target count, address count/bytes, headers, body, total
encoded bytes, mailbox names, and batch size. Results bound per-target details,
warnings, provider-code normalization, and aggregate serialization. Public send
results may include only reviewed fixed delivery-detail tags such as
`smtp-mail-rejected`, `smtp-recipient-rejected`, or `provider-timeout` alongside
the affected target. Unrecognized detail is omitted. Raw provider responses,
message content, credentials, stack traces, and uncontrolled local paths do not
enter public errors.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Every mutation revalidates current authority before each independent provider
   effect and resolves only the needed account/role secret.
2. Per-target results preserve caller order and distinguish success, failure,
   unknown, cancelled-before-effect, and local projection warning.
3. Body retrieval does not mark read by default; explicit mark-read and bounded
   approved flag additions/removals use one shared effect-aware implementation.
4. Move/archive/delete use native or proven scoped primitives, and tests prove no
   code path issues bare `EXPUNGE` or marks deleted before rejecting unsafe
   capability.
5. Provider success remains success when projection persistence fails.
6. SMTP and sent-copy outcomes are independently represented, and sent-copy
   failure/unknown never causes SMTP replay. Tests prove display names are safely
   formatted while the SMTP reverse-path uses only the configured account
   address, including when the display name itself contains `@` and when the
   account address requires SMTPUTF8/RFC 6532 serialization.
7. Cancellation and timeout tests cover before-effect, known-after-effect, and
   ambiguous boundaries for IMAP and SMTP.
8. Public numeric IDs are documented and tested as current-mailbox compatibility
   IDs, not durable listing-epoch tokens.
9. No management UI route can invoke mail mutations in this delivery.
10. Byte-level tests prove every IMAP APPEND path serializes MIME messages with
    CRLF line endings and emits no bare LF or CR line breaks.
11. Interoperability tests prove complete IMAP atom validation, full-message
    SMTPUTF8 detection and pre-effect rejection, display-name downgrade without
    a false SMTPUTF8 requirement, pre-SELECT RFC 6855 negotiation, exact literal8
    APPEND framing, and abort/no-replay behavior at ambiguous framing boundaries.
12. Forward executes source read, SMTP delivery, and sent copy as three
    independent effects with authority revalidated before each. Tests prove that a
    failed, denied, or allowlist-blocked source read aborts before any SMTP
    session opens, that re-attached parts preserve source MIME type and
    parameters, and that an existing `Fwd:` subject prefix is not duplicated.
13. Composition renders a caller-authored body from Markdown to email-safe HTML in
    one shared place, so every submission path inherits it, and an explicit raw-HTML
    body suppresses rendering. Quoted evidence carried from another message is
    escaped before rendering. Tests prove that rendering changes only the body
    part's subtype and never turns an ASCII-header message into one that requires
    SMTPUTF8, and that forwarded source markup is delivered literally.
14. A reply reads the message it quotes before the outgoing provider is opened, and
    the read is a distinct effect with its own authority resolution. Tests prove
    that a source which no searched mailbox holds degrades to an unquoted send,
    that every other read failure — unreadable, unparseable, oversized, timed out —
    aborts before any SMTP session opens rather than sending unquoted, that an
    allowlist-blocked source is indistinguishable from an absent one, and that the
    body carrying the appended quote is revalidated against the body bound.
